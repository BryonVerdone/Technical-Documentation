          <h1>Try React</h1>
          <p>
            React has been designed from the start for gradual adoption, and you
            can use as little or as much React as you need. Whether you want to
            get a taste of React, add some interactivity to a simple HTML page,
            or start a complex React-powered app, the links in this section will
            help you get started.
          </p>

          <h3>Online Playgrounds</h3>
          <p>
            If you're interested in playing around with React, you can use an
            online code playground. Try a Hello World template on CodePen,
            CodeSandbox, or Stackblitz.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you prefer to use your own text editor, you can also download
            this HTML file, edit it, and open it from the local filesystem in
            your browser. It does a slow runtime code transformation, so we'd
            only recommend using this for simple demos.
          </p>
          <h3>Add React to a Website</h3>
          <p>
            You can add React to an HTML page in one minute. You can then either
            gradually expand its presence, or keep it contained to a few dynamic
            widgets.
          </p>
          <h3>Create a New React App</h3>
          <p>
            When starting a React project, a simple HTML page with script tags
            might still be the best option. It only takes a minute to set up!
          </p>
          <p>
            As your application grows, you might want to consider a more
            integrated setup. There are several JavaScript toolchains we
            recommend for larger applications. Each of them can work with little
            to no configuration and lets you take full advantage of the rich
            React ecosystem. Learn how.

          <h1>Learn React</h1>
          <p>
            People come to React from different backgrounds and with different
            learning styles. Whether you prefer a more theoretical or a
            practical approach, we hope you'll find this section helpful.
          </p>
          <p>
            Like any unfamiliar technology, React does have a learning curve.
            With practice and some patience, you will get the hang of it.
          </p>
          <h3>First Examples</h3>
          <p>
            The React homepage contains a few small React examples with a live
            editor. Even if you don't know anything about React yet, try
            changing their code and see how it affects the result.
          </p>
          <h3>React for Beginners</h3>
          <p>
            If you feel that the React documentation goes at a faster pace than
            you're comfortable with, check out this overview of React by Tania
            Rascia. It introduces the most important React concepts in a
            detailed, beginner-friendly way. Once you're done, give the
            documentation another try!
          </p>
          <h3>React for Designers</h3>
          <p>
            If you're coming from a design background, these resources are a
            great place to get started.
          </p>
          <h3>JavaScript Resources</h3>
          <p>
            The React documentation assumes some familiarity with programming in
            the JavaScript language. You don't have to be an expert, but it's
            harder to learn both React and JavaScript at the same time.
          </p>
          <p>
            We recommend going through this JavaScript overview to check your
            knowledge level. It will take you between 30 minutes and an hour but
            you will feel more confident learning React.
          </p>
          <h3>Practical Tutorial</h3>
          <p>
            If you prefer to learn by doing, check out our practical tutorial.
            In this tutorial, we build a tic-tac-toe game in React. You might be
            tempted to skip it because you're not into building games — but give
            it a chance. The techniques you'll learn in the tutorial are
            fundamental to building any React apps, and mastering it will give
            you a much deeper understanding.
          </p>
          <h3>Step-by-Step Guide</h3>
          <p>
            If you prefer to learn concepts step by step, our guide to main
            concepts is the best place to start. Every next chapter in it builds
            on the knowledge introduced in the previous chapters so you won't
            miss anything as you go along.
          </p>
          <h3>Thinking in React</h3>
          <p>
            Many React users credit reading Thinking in React as the moment
            React finally “clicked” for them. It's probably the oldest React
            walkthrough but it's still just as relevant.
          </p>
          <h3>Recommended Courses</h3>
          <p>
            Sometimes people find third-party books and video courses more
            helpful than the official documentation. We maintain a list of
            commonly recommended resources, some of which are free.
          </p>
          <h3>Advanced Concepts</h3>
          <p>
            Once you're comfortable with the main concepts and played with React
            a little bit, you might be interested in more advanced topics. This
            section will introduce you to the powerful, but less commonly used
            React features like context and refs.
          </p>
          <h3>API Reference</h3>
          <p>
            This documentation section is useful when you want to learn more
            details about a particular React API. For example, React.Component
            API reference can provide you with details on how setState() works,
            and what different lifecycle methods are useful for.
          </p>
          <h3>Glossary and FAQ</h3>
          <p>
            The glossary contains an overview of the most common terms you'll
            see in the React documentation. There is also a FAQ section
            dedicated to short questions and answers about common topics,
            including making AJAX requests, component state, and file structure.

          The React blog is the official source for the updates from the React
          team. Anything important, including release notes or deprecation
          notices, will be posted there first.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can also follow the @reactjs account on Twitter, but you won't
          miss anything essential if you only read the blog.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not every React release deserves its own blog post, but you can find a
          detailed changelog for every release in the CHANGELOG.md file in the
          React repository, as well as on the Releases page.
        </p>

      <section class="main-section">
        <header id="versioned"><h1>Version Documentation</h1></header>
        <p>
          This documentation always reflects the latest stable version of React.
          Since React 16, you can find older versions of the documentation on a
          separate page. Note that documentation for past versions is
          snapshotted at the time of the release, and isn't being continuously
          updated.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section">
        <header id="something"><h1>Something Missing</h1></header>
        <p>
          If something is missing in the documentation or if you found some part
          confusing, please file an issue for the documentation repository with
          your suggestions for improvement, or tweet at the @reactjs account. We
          love hearing from you!
